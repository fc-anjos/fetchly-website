    description: "We start with a deep dive into your product, your users, and your goals. Just a real conversation about what you need built and why."
  - title: "Collaborative planning and strategy"
    description: "We map out every screen, feature, and milestone before writing a line of code. You review the plan, we adjust, and nothing moves forward until we agree on the direction."

faqItems:
  - question: "What exactly is included in the monthly plan?"
    answer: "A dedicated engineer for 150 hours per month, plus 50 supplemental hours covering software architecture, design, QA, DevOps, and project management. One plan, one team, every role you need."
  - question: "How is this different from staff augmentation?"
    answer: "Staff aug gives you one developer. Fetchly gives you a full product team: engineering, design, QA, architecture, DevOps, and a dedicated project manager. We're coordinated and accountable for outcomes, not just hours."
  - question: "Can I scale the engagement up or down?"
    answer: "Yes. Every engagement is month-to-month with no long-term contracts. Scale up when you need to move faster, scale down when things stabilize."
  - question: "How do you keep projects on track?"
    answer: "A dedicated project manager, weekly syncs, shared task boards, and regular progress reports. Nothing slips through the cracks."
  - question: "What if I already have an internal team?"
    answer: "We plug in alongside your existing team. We follow your processes, use your tools, and fill the gaps, whether that's extra engineering capacity, QA coverage, or design support."
